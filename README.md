# Case Converter Script

## Use Case:
During the COVID 19 Lockdowns, I took an online Russian class to pass the time. Part of this class involved learning vocabulary I was putting into a notecard app. There was good news, all of the vocal was already available for easy note card creation, but because we received our vocabulary list with the initial letter capitalized, the note card app rarely had the English word preloaded.
Unfortunately, Microsoft word did not make it easy to change the case of the case of Cyrillic words so I created a python script using the pdfplumber library. This cut down on the time it took to create my notecards so that I could spend more time going through them!
